## `distance.py`

The sample program demonstrates acquiring frames with distance / depth information only.

### Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites/dependencies:

  #### TauLidarCamera python module:

    #pip install TauLidarCamera

  #### OpenCV python module

    #pip install opencv-python


### How to Run

Command to run the program:

```    
#python distance.py
```

A new window rendering the 2D depth map will open:

## `distancePlusAmplitude.py`

### What this demonstrates

The sample program demonstrates acquiring frames with both distance / depth and amplitude image.

### Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites/dependencies:

  #### TauLidarCamera python module:

    #pip install TauLidarCamera

  #### OpenCV python module

    #pip install opencv-python

### How to Run

Command to run the program:

```    
#python distancePlusAmplitude.py
```

Two new windows will open to show the depth map and amplitude coming from the camera:

## `distancePlusGrayscale.py`

### What this demonstrates

The sample program demonstrates acquiring frames with both distance / depth and grayscale image.

### Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites/dependencies:

  #### TauLidarCamera python module:

    #pip install TauLidarCamera

  #### OpenCV python module

    #pip install opencv-python

### How to Run

Command to run the program:

```
#python distancePlusGrayscale.py
```  

Two new windows will open to show the depth map and grayscale image coming from the camera:

![](../docs/img/example-distance-grayscale-0.png)

## `multipleCameras.py`

### What this demonstrates

Rendering depth data from **ALL connected** Tau Cameras in real-time. You are only limited by the number of USB ports!

### Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites/dependencies:

  #### TauLidarCamera python module:

    #pip install TauLidarCamera

  #### OpenCV python module

    #pip install opencv-python



### How to Run

Command to run the program:

```
#python multipleCameras.py
```  

A new window for each connected camera will open, showing the depth map coming from each:

## Record and Playback Frames

These two example programs demonstrate using the Tau Camera to capture and store depth data, and then later playback the recording.

The recording program is very lightweight - minimal use of libraries and minimal processing of data - so it can run smoothly on lower power devices like the Omega2. Very useful if your application makes it difficult to have your Tau Camera tethered to a full computer at all times.

We've also made an example frame recording available. Check out the [example section](#an-example) below. **You don't need to have the Tau Camera hardware to try this out!**


### Recording Frames with `recordRawFrames.py`

Capture raw frames (binary bitstream) coming from the Tau Camera and write each frame to a file.

> This program is written to be as lightweight as possible - minimal use of libraries and minimal processing of data - so it can run smoothly on lower power devices like the Omega2

#### Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites/dependencies:

  #### TauLidarCamera python module:

    #pip install TauLidarCamera

#### How to Run

Command to run the program:

```
#python recordRawFrames.py
```  

Once it detects and initializes the camera, it will start capturing frames and writing them to disk. The frame files will be named according to the timestamp and placed in a new `samples` directory - for example: `samples/1616098779.62342.frame`

To stop capturing frames, press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal. You will see a `Shutting down ...` message.


### Replaying Recorded Frames with `replayRawFrames.py`

The `replayRawFrames.py` program allows you to **play back** any frames you've recorded. It will render the 2D depth map and amplitude view (using OpenCV) from each captured frame.

> You don't need the Tau Camera to run this program, just the recorded frames! Check out the example below to find out where to get some example frames.

#### Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites/dependencies:

  #### TauLidarCamera python module:

    #pip install TauLidarCamera

  #### OpenCV python module

    #pip install opencv-python

And some recorded frames

#### How to Run

Command to run the program:

```
#python replayRawFrames.py
```  

Two new windows will open. They will render the 2D depth map and amplitude view for each frame one by one:

![](../docs/img/example-replay-frames-0.png)

By default it will read all of the frames in the `samples` directory (in this `examples` directory). The program will end and the OpenCV windows will close when all of the frames have been played back.

#### Optional Argument

To point the playback to a different directory, run the program with an argument:

```
#python replayRawFrames.py <DIRECTORY WITH FRAMES>
```

### An Example

We've recorded a small selection of frames so you can test this out even if you don't have a Tau Camera. Follow along to try playing back frames on your own computer.

1. Grab the example programs by cloning the [tau-lidar-camera GitHub repo](https://github.com/OnionIoT/tau-lidar-camera) to your computer:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/OnionIoT/tau-lidar-camera.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the `examples` directory
  ```
  cd tau-lidar-camera/examples
  ```
3. Make sure you have Python3.7 or higher and the [pre-requisites for `replayRawFrames.py`](#pre-requisites-5) installed
4. Download this zip file of recorded frames: https://onion-downloads.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tau/sample-frames/tau-frames-windowsill-0.zip
5. Unzip it and you'll have a new `windowsill-0` directory
6. Run the playback program and point it to the `windowsill-0` directory:
  ```
  #python replayRawFrames.py windowsill-0
  ```

For reference, a regular photo of the windowsill can be found at `windowsill-0/rgb-photo`. Take a look and see how it compares to the Tau's recorded frames!


### Next Steps

A few ideas on what to do next:

* Try playing with the parameters passed to `Camera.setRange()` in the `replayRawFrames.py` program and see how it changes the 2D depth map
* If you have the Tau Camera hardware, try recording your own frames and playing them back!
* The record frames program is very lightweight, it can run on systems like the Onion Omega2. You can try using an Omega2 with a Tau Camera to capture frames and then play them back over your network ðŸ˜‰
* **Try building on top of these example programs.** They're a solid foundation for your own, more complete record and playback implementation -- very useful if you don't want your Tau Camera to be tethered to a full computer at all times.
